## Mario Dodger

**Mario Dodger** is a Python game where players control Mario to dodge Goombas in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. The goal is to avoid colliding with the Goombas for as long as possible, earning points for each Goomba that spawns.

## Features

- **Mario Control**: Players control Mario's movement using the mouse.
- **Goomba Spawning**: Goombas spawn at random locations and speeds, bouncing around the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when Mario collides with a Goomba.
- **Replay Option**: After a game over, players can choose to play again or quit.
- **Custom Graphics**: The game features custom images for Mario, Goombas, and the background.
- **Score Tracking**: The final score is based on how many Goombas spawned before Mario's collision.

## Program Flow

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins with an initial prompt to press the spacebar.
2. **Control Mario**: Move Mario using the mouse to dodge incoming Goombas.
3. **Avoid Goombas**: Goombas bounce around the screen randomly, and the player must avoid them.
4. **Game Over**: When Mario collides with a Goomba, the game ends and the player's score is displayed. The player is then given the option to play again.
